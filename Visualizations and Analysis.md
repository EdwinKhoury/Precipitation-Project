## **Daily Maximum Precipitation over the Years**

In the above bar chart, the maximum 24-hour rainfall depth is displayed over the year. In 1996 as well as in 2003, the rainfall depth in St. Louis, Missouri, reached a maximum of 5.1 inches (13cm). On the other hand, in 1988, the maximum 24-hour rainfall depth happened to be the lowest of all the years, with a depth of 0.6 inches (1.5cm). There are no obvious patterns in the bar chart, hence no correlation between precipitation and time.


## **Theoretical Vs Experimental Hourly Precipitation**
