## **Daily Maximum Precipitation over the Years**

The bar chart above illustrates the maximum 24-hour rainfall depth throughout the year. Notably, both 1996 and 2003 recorded the highest rainfall depth in St. Louis, Missouri, at 5.1 inches (13cm). Conversely, in 1988, the lowest 24-hour rainfall depth in all the years was observed, measuring just 0.6 inches (1.5cm). The bar chart does not reveal any discernible patterns, indicating an absence of correlation between precipitation and time.


## **Theoretical Vs Experimental Hourly Precipitation**

I assessed the code's precision by contrasting the theoretically projected hourly maximum precipitation data for specific years with the empirical data published on NOAA's website. More than 60% of the theoretical results are similar to those of the experiments, proving the code's accuracy. 14 out of the 36 hourly maximums are incorrect, with an average margin of error of 0.23 inches.
